Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

有一个整数的数组,给定一个值,返回数组中两个元素之和等于给定值的元素下标.
每个值有且只有一个解.不能使用同一个元素两次.
